Can the team accept the friend request(at least one of them) so we can create a group chat, according to @Away✈ kartoonjoy  wardens should create group chat with the sponsor so we save time for both sides

I Would like to hear about this from the protocol team too. But I don't think so current in-scope code is audited. Because AxelarGateway's audited code is out of scope

When chain a sends a message to chain b, the contract on chain A sends an event and the axeler network listens for this event and then calls the execute function on chain b


[07/16/2023 07:12] 0xjuntao
yeah in execute function AxelarGateway will validate the call, trying to figure out how it works under the hood```        if (!gateway.validateContractCall(commandId, sourceChain, sourceAddress, payloadHash))
            revert NotApprovedByGateway();```


[07/16/2023 07:19] zhaojie
execute function is called by a network node that has the source code in their github repository and is based on the cosmos sdk.

[07/16/2023 17:59] viktor_cortess
Hi guys, As I understand the idea of interchain token part of this contest is to transfer tokens and to transfer tokens with a call. And sending some data to the other chain without transferring tokens is out of scope?


[07/16/2023 19:19] viktor_cortess
Does anybody understand how this flows thing works? In the giveToken function we send tokens, but addFlowIn.  As I understand it's a limit to avoid huge transactions, but why it's out with every transfer of tokens and in with the simple transfer of tokens in a giveToken function?

I've not participated to many contests so far but this is by a long way the most frustrating. I guess the team can conversely see it as a compliment - fewer findings, better job 😅 
At least this Create3 thing is a very nice learning I had not seen around yet. Not giving up just yet though 🥸

[07/18/2023 09:04] _3doc_
trying to answer here, the team will correct me when available if I am wrong:
this function computes the address of a deployed contract through the create3 method. Since the create3 method is a combination of "create2" and a subsequent "create", the 2 lines there compute the addresses of the contracts deployed with these two methods in order


[07/18/2023 09:05] _3doc_
so `deployed = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'd6_94', deployer, hex'01')))));` computes the address of the first contract deployed via "create" by the auxiliary contract at the address "deployer" (which in turn is created via a create2 call)


[07/18/2023 09:07] 0xnirlin
Why hex'd6_94' and hex'01' specifically


[07/18/2023 09:08] 0xnirlin
thanks for response though


[07/18/2023 11:43] pcarranzav
Hey folks, looking at AxelarServiceGovernance / InterchainGovernance. The governance address that sends the cross-chain approvals i.e. sourceAddress sending a message from the sourceChain: is that generally going to be a Multisig or some other contract?


[07/18/2023 12:01] _3doc_
that has to do with how contract addresses are computed in solidity: 01 is the nonce, and d6 94 is the header added by the RLP encoding https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-ethereum-contract-computed

 function deployedAddress(address sender, bytes32 salt) internal pure returns (address deployed) {
        address deployer = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'ff', sender, salt, DEPLOYER_BYTECODE_HASH)))));

        deployed = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'd6_94', deployer, hex'01')))));
    }
```

the answer:

```
address deployer = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'ff', sender, salt, DEPLOYER_BYTECODE_HASH)))))
This line computes the address where the CreateDeployer contract would be deployed via a CREATE2 operation, based on the sender (which is the address of the contract that calls the deploy function), a salt, and the DEPLOYER_BYTECODE_HASH (which is the keccak256 hash of the CreateDeployer contract's bytecode).

deployed = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hex'd6_94', deployer, hex'01')))))
The second line takes the address of the CreateDeployer contract (calculated in the previous step), and uses it to compute another address, this time using a different prefix (hex'd6_94) and suffix (hex'01). This additional hash operation is used to compute the address of the contract that will be deployed using the CREATE opcode by the CreateDeployer contract.

Addresses are treated as strings to allow for non-evm chain support in the feature, and they must be converted to lowercase to avoid case differences leading to inequality when in fact the addresses are equal.

``        if (tokenManagerRequiresApproval()) {
            uint256 allowance_ = allowance[sender][address(tokenManager)];
            if (allowance_ != type(uint256).max) {
                if (allowance_ > type(uint256).max - amount) {
                    allowance_ = type(uint256).max - amount;
                }

                _approve(sender, address(tokenManager), allowance_ + amount);
            }
``


[07/19/2023 03:53] josephdara
What's the use of this in the code ? @dean.axelar 🙏 

Because it does not max approve the allowance for the tokenManager when the current allowance is less than type(uint256).max - amount


[07/19/2023 03:53] josephdara
Source: InterchainToken.sol


[07/19/2023 04:21] _3doc_
1. It increases the allowance by ‘amount’ when it’s not already at max
2. It protects from overflowing uint256 when needed

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[07/19/2023 04:26] josephdara
Ok, thanks
In some cases, the allowance might be enough to cover the amount though. Having to always increase approval whether it's enough or not for the transaction is extra gas for users I believe
But that's probably a QA

[07/19/2023 11:38] neon2835
guys, can someone tell me which file is the calculation logic code for transaction fees or network fees? I can't find the code related to fee calculation


[07/19/2023 12:37] _3doc_
if you are referring to the bridged calls i.e. InterchainProposalSender's gas values of the calls, that's in my understanding up to the caller to estimate how much gas to refund to cover the call, and that can very well happen off-chain


[07/19/2023 12:46] neon2835
In addition to gas fees, do nodes and verifiers not need to pay for fees?

Hi guys, sorry for the stupid question but where does commandId value come from? in tests it's a random value. commandId = getRandomBytes32() . In axelarGateway it's always an input parameter. But how is the commandId formed?

There is no info about express receiving, so I googled and found this. Is it true?
GMP Express
Privileged clients (protocols) can be allowed by Axelar to use the Express version of the messaging protocol. A standard message can take several minutes for the Axelar network to fully approve the message and pass it to the final destination. The express message will still go through the Axelar network, but GMP Express Service will lend any sent tokens to the destination address while approval is happening. Once the complete approval is done, tokens are paid back to the GMP Express service. This process can speed up the cross-chain transfer more than ten times. The crucial part of GMP Express is complete trust between the privileged protocol and Axelar. The privileged protocol MUST implement the logic for token returns when a standard message is received. Otherwise, the privileged protocol will receive 2x more tokens. See ExpressExecutable for more information.

in the `getRemoteAddress` did the if statement will run only for the non evm chains or it runs for all support and non support chains?!


[07/21/2023 06:32] dean.axelar#1908
This works for both EVM and non-EVM chains. If the if-statement passes that means we are referring to an EVM chain in which case the address will be the interchainTokenServiceAddress which is constant across EVM chains.
